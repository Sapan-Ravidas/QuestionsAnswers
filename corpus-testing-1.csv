What are the pre-processing technique used in Natural Language?	natural_language_processing.txt	0.003679351650648048	For instance, the term neural machine translation (NMT) emphasizes the fact that deep learning-based approaches to machine translation directly learn sequence-to-sequence transformations, obviating the need for intermediate steps such as word alignment and language modeling that was used in statistical machine translation (SMT).	5.105766326641055
When UnderFiting occurs?	probability.txt	0.0004684913810951427	If either event A or event B but never both occurs on a single performance of an experiment, then they are called mutually exclusive events.	5.631211781821365
When Overfitting occurs?	machine_learning.txt	0.000525111500424201	But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.	4.712528704308591
When SVM is better than other model?	machine_learning.txt	0.0010370623945001663	Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.	7.561838975406982
