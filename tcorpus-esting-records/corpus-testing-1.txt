Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as "normal" and "abnormal" and involves training a classifier (the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). = 4.42484663185681
Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems. = 3.979757851720499
Machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people. = 3.979757851720499

Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems.
